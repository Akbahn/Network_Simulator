# JavaFX Network Simulator

*JavaFX Network Simulator* is a desktop application that lets users build and simulate computer networks with a drag-and-drop interface. Create PC nodes, connect them with virtual cables, and execute basic commands like ping via an integrated terminal.
Network events are animated in real-time and logged into a database for persistence.
## Features
* **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Easily add PC nodes to the canvas.
* Network Topology: Connect and disconnect nodes to simulate network links.
* Simulated Terminal: Interact with each PC using commands (e.g., ping).
* Animation & Simulation: Visualize packet transfers, delays, and network behavior.
* Database Logging: Save and review network configurations and activity logs.

## Getting Started
**Prerequisites**
* JDK  or later
* JavaFX SDK
* IntelliJ IDEA
## Installation
**Clone the Repository:**

`git clone https://github.com/Nadir-Kutluozen/Network_Simulator.git `

`cd Network_Simulator `
## Usage
Add a PC: Drag a PC icon onto the canvas to create a new network node.
Connect PCs: Draw lines between nodes to simulate network cables.
Open Terminal: Click a PC to open its terminal and execute network commands like ping.
Review Logs: Check the database for persisted network configurations and command logs.
